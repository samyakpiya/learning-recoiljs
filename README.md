# Todo List App

I'm actively contributing to the Open Source project, [TwentyCRM](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty), that uses [recoiljs](https://recoiljs.org/) for state management.

This is a simple todo-list app built with react and recoiljs for the purpose of learning and practicing recoiljs.
